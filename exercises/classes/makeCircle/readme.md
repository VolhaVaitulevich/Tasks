## Find the Second Largest Number

Your task is to create a Circle constructor that creates a circle with a radius provided by an argument. The circles constructed must have two methods getArea() (PI*r^2) and getPerimeter() (2*PI\*r) which give both respective areas and perimeter (circumference).

### Examples:

> let circy = new Circle(11)
> circy.getArea()
> // Should return 380.132711084365

> let circy = new Circle(4.44)
> circy.getPerimeter()
> // Should return 27.897342763877365
